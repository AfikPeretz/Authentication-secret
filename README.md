# Authentication-secret
The purpose of this project is to use today's industry accepted practices to make our site a safer place, for us and for our users.
For this purpose, I implemented security layers for the project step by step and separated them by commits, so that you can progress between the commits and see which layer was added from time to time, detail of the security layers:
1. env variable
2. hashing for encryption
3. hash function (bcrypt)
4. cookies & sessions
5. Login & register with Google

I highly recommend downloading the project to your computer and running it.
For any problem you encounter, feel free to contact me privately, enjoy!
